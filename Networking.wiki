example
1 pod on 1 node
the node is hosting on 192.168.1.2
internal ip 10.244.0.0 //this network assigns ip to the pods
Note: Nodes can have the same internal ip as one another
the pod is hosting on 10.244.0.2
this is not the ip on the system

Rules
All containers/pods need to communicate to each other without NAT
All nodes ....

Creating a cluster
Seperate services handle the routing of all the different nodes
This creates different ip address so there is no conflicts
