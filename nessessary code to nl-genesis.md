Possible things to do:

- [X] Look into the oclif and why we get these timeouts with prompts
- [X] Add some config for helm and env
- [X] Add some launch.json stuff
- [X] Perhaps add a README.md that goes some basic instructions for how to add stuff
- [X] Come up with some better feedback.
- [X] Find better way to log.
- [X] Debugging more cases.
- [ ] Add in the spinners. Doesn't seem feasiable
