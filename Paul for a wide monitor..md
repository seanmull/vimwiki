Request for Ultra-wide monitor

I'd like to request an ultra-wide monitor in lieu of the current two-monitor setup I have.

Here is the one I am interested in:

Here is some alternatives. (Works good but a little pricer, but more available):

The buisness case for the ultra-wide over 2 monitors:
- I like larger font since my eyes are not as good as they used to be.  A wide monitor allows me to see the code all way to the margin.  Some people go with 14px or 16px, I like more around 22 - 24px
- Tabing is "way" faster then tiling.
- My IDE has better preview if you have more horizonal space.  This is helpful with looking though backends with tons of references all over the place.
- Pricing seems similar between two monitors.  When I talked to Glenn he mentioned the dells that I have are around 250-300 a pop.

Thanks for the consideration.
Sean
