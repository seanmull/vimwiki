# Tasks for OCD chatterbox

-   [x] Ask if we want all backends to enforce strict typing. This is something that has to be discussed in meeting between developers.

        and folder structure structure but striped down.
-   [x] Need understand how the workspaces thing to create dependency tree.
-   [x] Check if files are still removed.
-   [x] Move all the shared stuff and test if everything works in OCD.
-   [x] Do a little research with redis just to understand how it works.

-   [x] Get connected to RMQ
