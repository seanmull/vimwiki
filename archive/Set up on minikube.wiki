Set up for minikube

Minikube - sets up a single node kube cluster that is available on the cloud
in an iso image

Minikube has a command that will take the iso and deploy it on a VM.
Kubectl is the command line tool needed to interact with K8

May need to clear the config files if you have problems with docker socket
