Hi miles,

I hope everything is going well with you.  I just wanted to let you know I have just
accepted an offer on mom's place.  Era should be able to fill you in on the details. 

Here are some stuff you need to know:
- It is a 60-day escrow.  
- They should come by soon to inspect the house. 

I think Era is trying to help you find a place.  I would hope that the slow down in the market
makes a little easier to find an affordable rental that meets you needs.

I appreciate so much what you have done for mom and I want to help in anyway that I can.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make this process go a lot smoother.

Sean
