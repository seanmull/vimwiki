Dear Najju,

This marks the 10th year of our marriage and I couldn't be happier that we are together.  I know its been hard moving the country again, but I'm feeling confident we can start our new life with the support of your wonderful family.  You have been the rock holding together our rag-tag group of misfits, and I just wanted you to know that I love you.   

To growing old together and being that cheesy couple from the hallmark cards,
Sean
