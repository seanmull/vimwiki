Telepresence

Reduces inner loop pain

Inner loop -> code -> build -> test -> commit
Outer loop -> push it into deploy
           -> same as inner loop it makes the work double
           
Want to avoid docker build/ push
Want to use my own tools

Can I work on it all on my systems -
    too reasource heavy
    
Its like putting your local laptop in a kube
cluster

Creates a network bridge

How it works
1. It swaps the deployment with a proxy
2. Requests the proxy be sent to the laptop
Any inbound traffic gets directed to your local
machine
Send the traffic back into cluster

It also
1. Intercepts DNS
2. Environment variables and secrets
3. Volumes
4. TCP in addition to HTTP

You are in the namespace and same filesystem

Benefits
  Any tools that works on your laptop can be used
  Manipulate the traffic
  Connect to cloud-based reasources can be accessed 
  Same network namesspace (nslookup works)
  Very fast inner loop
  
Simple workflow
Testing in production is risky
1. One cluster that is single source of truth
2. Developer checks out code and works on microservices
3. Swapping services on demand using telepresence + IDE
4. Telepresence is used in vpn-tcp mode
5. Once code is done, microserveces are build and deployed via pipeline

Typical workflow
1. One dev cluster for single source of truth
2. Devs check out one of the microservices (this needs to be coordated with other since others may be using something that depends on what you using)
3. Dev Telepresence and IDE
4. Vpn-tcp mode
5. Once code is done, CircleCI is used to run tests, build and deploy


Telepresence proxies to dev machine into the
cluster
