Hi Allison,

Just wanted to give you an update on whats going on with the estate.  Unfortunately, I cannot continue as the trustee for trust since opening an account required me to go back to the US.  My sister will now continue to act as the trustee, this point moving forward.   She will be opening the bank account to transfer the escrow money.  The plan is to have this done this up coming Monday. 

Please let me know if new paperwork needs to made now that things have changed hands.

Thanks
Sean
