Rules about keys
1. Not too long since lookup will be slow.
2. Not too short since key will be hard to remember.
3. Try to use a schema like "object-type:id" since its easy to remember.



# TODO
Look the ioRedis repo.  It has some cool examples, even some in typescript. Focus on hashes.

Functions to learn about since it was in Nessie:
- hdel
- hset
- hget
- createRedisKey
- createRedisPartialKey
- IORedis.Redis
- hmset
- hgetall
- ioRedis npm package
- redis.pipeline()
- redis.scanStream()
