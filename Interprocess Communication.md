Independant process - cannot affect or be affected by other process
Cooperating processes - those that are not independant

cooperation:
- Information sharing
- Computational speedup - run concurrently
- Modularity - dividing systems into different parts
- Convience - doing more then one thing at time.  

Two model:

Shared memory - region of memory is shared and read/write is done on that region
Message passing - message passed between each other.  Sent back and forth through the kernel
