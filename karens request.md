General:
What are the most important things you would tell a new staff member starting at Nightlife?

- Its a very flat workstructure.  Not alot of pulling rank on decisions.
- The partys and events are well planned and fun for the whole family.
- The training is well conducted.

What are the things we didn’t tell you in your first few weeks that you wish you knew earlier?

- Some media player training earlier, would have been preferred.

What are your highlights from your time at Nightlife so far?

- Christmas party. Tim's the man.

What are the lowlights from your time at Nightlife so far?

- Not really any so far.

Do you read the Ops notes? – Do you find them helpful? 

- Not particularly.

Do you read the MOTDs? – Do you find them helpful? 

-  I enjoy them.  Alot of thought gets put into the gifs, style and presentations.  Good work!

How do you like to be communicated to?

-  I don't really understand this question but .... sure?

Do you think there is any confusion around the multiple communication channels (email, teams, FYI etc.)? Do you know when to use each channel? 

-  Its a bit much.  I really prefer teams for 90% of what I do.  If its really technical/specific I like the more long form format such as confluence/email.

Knowing what you know now about the core values of Nightlife – was it what you expected? Is the culture as described/what it appears to be?

-  I think alot of it is pretty obvious.

Thinking about your Intranet training put into action—what do you wish you knew sooner?

- Never had intranet training.  It was mostly on the job, not formalized.

How relevant do you think your Intranet training was?

- See previous response.

Do you know how to add a contribution, add a note or find a client homepage on the Intranet?

- Do we do this anymore?  I remember doing this before we had aussie timesheets.

What do you perceive the product to be?

- Its a few things from my understanding:
    - Programming music to fit the buisness need of the client.
    - The music jukebox that stores the music.
    - The apps that provide access to the music.
    - Technical support services to help the customer figure out how to use the product.

I didn't mention other groups, since I don't fully get what you definition of "product" is?

How often do you use the apps? – Do you use/have a home system? 

Not as often as I would like.  I have a home system.

How would you describe the training material (such as the Employee Handbook + Foundation Training Manual)? E.g. sufficient/adequate/relevant/lacking

Its pretty good.

Were you shown how to access training materials – particularly the information required to do your job?

Yes.

Is there anything to do with the Nightlife office that you wish you knew sooner? 

Nope.

Is there anything you weren’t told about payslips or sick/annual leave? 

Nope.

Is there anything you weren’t told about dress codes, office hours or the carpark?

Nope.
