6 - 9 month plan

Cloud Platform space

Logging pipeline
  all developers should be able to look at the logs
  impacts everyone 
  issue since pod can crash and we have no logs
  
Seperation of responsibilies
Cloud
- builds and maintains logging solution
DevOp
- trained on how to use the tools
- use the tools to diagnose problems

CI pipelines
- issues are that everyone has there own tools
- lack of documentation
- most focus was on mono
- live and intranet do not use this pipeline

Learning the development environment
Deep understand of how its built
Then once I am good I look at the CI/CD pipeline

we don't route the four network to HDMS
nms and apps need access to the live server
the loadbalancer
vpn may needs to be on the hdms
