Hello Mr. Roebig,

This is Sean Mull, the father of Lilyana Ranjit Mull.  I wanted to thank you for being my
daugthers teacher.  You have done an excellent job!  We have recently recieved her report
card and would like to get some more specifics on what areas she can improve on.  More specifically
the maths.

We have been working through her notebooks and everything we see is correct.

Any advice or comments would be much appreicated.

Thanks and Happy Holidays,
Sean and Najju
