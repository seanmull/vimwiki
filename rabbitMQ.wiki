Jargon
1. Producing: a program that sends messages
2. Queue: a postbox that lives in rabbitMQ
3. Consuming: a program that waits to recieve messages

Steps to create a producer
1. Connect to rabbitMQ server
2. Create a channel
3. Declare a queue we want to send to
4.  We give it a name that must match what is requested from the consumer
5. Send message to queue
6. Close the connection and exit

Steps to create a consumer
Similar to producer only we consume messages and listen for any other messages

RPC pattern

But what if we need to run a function on a remote computer 
and wait for the result? Well, that's a different story. This 
pattern is commonly known as Remote Procedure Call or RPC.
